            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi my name is Stacy and I am a student at CodeFellows working toward becoming a software developer. In my past, I went college at Seattle U for one year studying forensic psychology. Decided to switched roles and went to Toni and Guy hairdressing academy where I received my cosmetology license. For the past 8+ years, I was working at a salon on Capitol hill in Seattle Washington. Prior to that, I worked for 6 years as a science interpreter for the Pacific Science Center. My future goals are to excel through school, work at a company as a software developer, learn a new language, traveling and buy a house.</p>
